# SigmaProject

Python code repository for Data Science, Machine Learning and Computer Vision, among other goodies. Code here it's just for learning purposes, NOT for production.

## Functions
- **Math**
  - Numerical integration using Monte Carlo methods
- **Data Science**
  - See folder notebooks
- **Machine Learning**
  - Neural Networks 

## Credits
- The **Neural Network** implementation in this project was done with the help of this other project. https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn-from-scratch.ipynb. Some code was borrowed from the latter project.
