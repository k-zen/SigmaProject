    "(10 points) Implement a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification. This classifier will be used to classify fortune cookie messages into two classes: messages that predict what will happen in the future and messages that just contain a wise saying. We will label messages that predict what will happen in the future as class 1 and messages that contain a wise saying as class 0. For example,\n",

    "- \"Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line\" would be a message in class 0.\n",
    "- \"You will get an A in SENG 474\" would be a message in class 1.\n",

Report the accuracy in results.txt (along with a comment saying what files you used for the training and testing data). In this situation, you are training and testing on the same data. This is a sanity check: your accuracy should be very high i.e. > 90%\n",
